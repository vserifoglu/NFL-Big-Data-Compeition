## Common Patterns Across Winners

### Validation Characteristics:
1. **Minimal but Present:** All include some statistical proof
2. **Concise:** 1-3 pages maximum on validation
3. **Visual Proof:** Box plots, distributions more convincing than p-values
4. **Football Sense:** Metrics align with known elite players/teams
5. **No Prediction Focus:** Explanatory analysis, not forecasting

### Content Allocation:
| Component | Typical Allocation |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Validation/Proof | 20-30% |
| Insights/Analysis | 40-50% |
| Visualizations | 20-30% |
| Narrative/Storytelling | Throughout |

### Success Factors:
1. ✅ **Novelty:** Metrics/approach not previously seen
2. ✅ **Actionability:** Teams can implement findings immediately
3. ✅ **Clarity:** Non-technical audience can understand value

## Key Takeaways for Our Submission

### What Winners Do:
- Validate minimally but convincingly (proof metrics work)
- Focus heavily on insights and actionable recommendations
- Prioritize clear, compelling visualizations over complex models
- Answer: "How does this change my job next Sunday?"
- Use storytelling to make metrics memorable

### What Winners Avoid:
- Over-validating with academic rigor (diminishing returns)
- Complex predictive models when not required
- Dense statistical sections that lose audience
- Metrics without clear football interpretation
- Poor visualization quality or confusing presentation

### Strategic Implications:
Our **Path C (Hybrid)** approach aligns with winner patterns:
- **15% validation** = Sufficient proof (winners: 20-30%)
- **85% insights/viz/story** = High-impact focus (winners: 70-80%)
- Balance satisfies both credibility and impact requirements
